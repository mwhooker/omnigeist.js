need to do reverse url shortening -- pass it an expanded url, go out and find
all the possible short-urls, and use those to seed the fanout

ditch jquery in favor of lighter-weight frameworks:

OR
 rename $ to $omnigeist to prevent conflicts?



UI
  close button
  expand short URLs in comments?

  tabs
    make them look like tabs (color, corners)
    add story count
    automatically add tabs to the dom depending on which sources we get back
    add source icon to tab?
    wire them up

  let user resize horizontal dimensions

node 0.6.0 & package updates broke some shit
   * less.js & coffee-script are broken in npm
   * had to use less.js HEAD with patches from
       https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/pull/377
    * had to use coffee-script HEAD

disqus-node isn't in npm. I've applied a custom patch

Need to figure out how to get my disqus key out of source.
    TODO: filter history to get rid of the key before I push.
