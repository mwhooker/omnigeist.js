need to do reverse url shortening -- pass it an expanded url, go out and find
all the possible short-urls, and use those to seed the fanout

rewrite hrefs in comments to use my bit.ly api key, but make sure url text remains unchanged

ditch jquery in favor of lighter-weight frameworks:

OR
 rename $ to $omnigeist to prevent conflicts?



UI
  close button
  expand short URLs in comments?

  tabs
    make them look like tabs (color, corners)
    add story count
    automatically add tabs to the dom depending on which sources we get back
    add source icon to tab?
    wire them up

  let user resize horizontal dimensions
